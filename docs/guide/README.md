# Introduction

`Lararole` is a Laravel library, provides `Role Management` with `permissions`.
Basically this library provides a basic structure of application and instructions to use it. Using this manageable structure you can build large and robust applications.

Lararole is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Each module belongs to any role and that role has read or write permission.
User can't visit module any page without any permission. Even Without write permission User can't perform any action like create, update or delete.
These permissions are controlled by middleware `permission.read` and `permission.write`.
